1. Install to BIN="/mnt/volume1/SG10K-SV-NOTEBOOK/noncoding/bin" # Edit bin to your local path in .sh script
a. bedGraphToBigWig in BIN folder
b. bedops in BIN folder
c. bedtools in $PATH

2. To Run
After running main.nf for the noncoding analysis, result folder should have this 4 subfolder
a. pipeline_info
b. iter-summaries
c. main-vcf-summaries
d. shuffled_bed
proc_bedgraph2bigWig.sh assumes the parameter FOLDER=<nextflow_result_folder>
CMD:
./proc_bedgraph2bigWig.sh >bigWig.log 2>bigWig.error

3. Result
Generated bigWig (.bw) file can be visualized in IGV to view the permutated VCF coordinates coverage on the human genome. 
Main assumption is that permutation will not be bias and we should see an even coverage of genome.
